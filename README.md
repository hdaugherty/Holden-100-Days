# 100-days-Holden

This is my github repo I built for my Python #100DaysOfCode course I am taking with mikeckennedy @TalkPython and @pybites.

I will house all of the project in this repo for anyone else to use and see. I am still new to Python and still learning so take my methods with a grain of salt.

Hope it can help someone and Happy Coding!
